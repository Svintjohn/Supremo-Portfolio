# John's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and contact information.  
It was built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a simple and responsive design.  
The purpose of this site is to give a quick overview of who I am as a developer and make it easy for people to explore my work or contact me.
